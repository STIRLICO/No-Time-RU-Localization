This is a log of my research on the pet capsule.

--Note to future self--
Perhaps, had I not delved so much 
into time travel, maybe then I would have been able to invest 
more time into this project.

I need to stuff that hole in the wall, coco crabs keep pouring through!

--The idea and technicalities--
The abstract idea was simple, have a hand held device which could hold
any wild animal and make it tame as long as you take good care with it.

The device should be no bigger than a tennis ball, the device inside, together with the
magnetometer, shrinks matter into tiny form. I had done work on such matter in the past.

I had only pieces of work left from the dimension case project, which I sadly
lost years ago. It worked similar but on a bigger scope, with more items!

--Usage--
The device works in such a way, that only tame or weakened animals would allow themselves
to be captured. [Below three hearts on the animal strength index]

After throwing the device at the target, the subject would be enveloped into the
dimension which contains a friendly habitat for the animal, however letting it out
every now and again and feeding it will help it to keep a good spirit.

If the animal was captured, throw the ball to let it out, or interact with it
to make it return into the capsule.

--Afterthoughts--
Maybe one day I will be able to fulfill my dreams and time travel 
into the past capturing baby mammoths!
Alas that day may never come, but who knows.
